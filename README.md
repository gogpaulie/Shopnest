# Shopnest

This is a full-stack (MERN) ecommerce application.

I learned a lot making this app. 

Front-end: 
React using hooks and Redux for state management. After struggling to graps the idea of "prop drilling", Redux has a natural workflow that didn't take long to understand. Setting up your constants, reducers, and actions are very straight forward. 
For styling I used React-bootstrap with some layered CSS on top.

Back-end:
The app uses 3 models/Schemas: Users that log into the store, the products we sell on the store, and orders sent in by the users.
